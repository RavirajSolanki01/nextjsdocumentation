# Next.js 14 Documentation: A Comprehensive Guide for Web Developers

Next.js is a robust framework for React.js, offering a rich set of features for building scalable and high-performance web applications. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of various Next.js concepts, from initializing a project to advanced rendering strategies.

## Initializing a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app <project name>
```

For instance, to create a new project named "todolist":

```bash
npx create-next-app todolist
```

During the setup process, you will be prompted with several configuration options. Here's what to choose:

- **TypeScript**: Yes
- **ESLint**: Yes
- **Tailwind CSS**: Yes
- **Use `src/` Directory**: Yes
- **App Router**: Yes
- **Customize the Default Import Alias (@/**)**: No

Once the installation is complete, you can run your development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Routing in Next.js
Routing in Next.js is folder-based, allowing you to create new routes by adding folders within the `app` directory. Here's an overview of the routing features:

### Basic Routes
To create a new route, simply add a folder with the desired route name and create a `page.tsx` file within it. For example, to create a `/login` route:

- Create a `login` folder.
- Add a `page.tsx` file with a functional React component.

```jsx
export default function LoginPage() {
  return <div>Login Page</div>;
}
```

**Note**: Naming conventions are case-sensitive, and you must use `page.tsx` as the filename.

### Nested Routes
For nested routes, create a subfolder within the parent folder. For example, to create a nested route `/login/olduser`:

- Create an `olduser` folder inside `login`.
- Add a `page.tsx` file.

```jsx
export default function OldUserPage() {
  return <div>Old User Page</div>;
}
```

### Dynamic Routes
To create dynamic routes, use square brackets `[]` for folder names. For example, if the route is `users/<userid>`, you can create a folder named `[userid]` and extract the parameter from `params` in your component.

```jsx
const UserId = ({ params }) => {
  return <div>User ID: {params.userid}</div>;
};

export default UserId;
```

### Similar Routes
If multiple routes share a common functionality, you can use round brackets `()` to group them without affecting the routing path. For example, authentication routes (register, login, signup) can be grouped under `(auth)` to simplify the folder structure.

### Catch-All Segments
To handle complex nested routes, you can use `[...slug]` to create a catch-all segment. This is useful when you want to match various paths with different levels of nesting.

```jsx
const CatchAll = ({ params }) => {
  return <div>Path: {params.slug.join('/')}</div>;
};

export default CatchAll;
```

### Custom 404 Pages
Next.js provides a default 404 page, but you can create a custom one by adding a `not-found.tsx` file in your route folder. This allows you to customize the 404 message and style.

```jsx
export default function NotFound() {
  return <div>Page Not Found</div>;
}
```

If you want to trigger a 404 page conditionally, you can import `notFound` from `next/navigation` and call it in your component based on a specific condition.

```jsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

if (someCondition) {
  notFound();
}
```

### Private Folders
If you want to create private folders that are not part of the routing structure, you can use an underscore `_` prefix in the folder name. For example, a folder named `_lib` will not be accessible as a route in the browser.

### Layouts
Layouts are components that persist across multiple routes, allowing you to share a common structure or state. Define a layout by exporting a default React component from a `layout.tsx` file. You can create individual layout files for each route or share a layout across multiple routes.

```jsx
export default function MainLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="main-layout">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Metadata
Metadata helps with SEO by providing information like the title and description of a page. Both `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` can export metadata, with the former applying to all pages within a layout, and the latter applying only to the specific page.

```jsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Page',
  description: 'This is my page description.',
};
```

### Link Component
The `Link` component in Next.js is used to navigate between routes. It extends the HTML anchor tag, providing additional functionality like prefetching and client-side navigation.

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/product">Go to Product Page</Link>
```

You can use the `replace` attribute to clear navigation history when navigating to a new page.

```jsx
<Link href="/product" replace>Product Page</Link>
```

### Programmatic Navigation
To navigate programmatically based on certain conditions, use the `useRouter` hook. This is useful for redirecting users based on logic or events.

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

const Component = () => {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleOrder = () => {
    router.push('/payment');
  };

  return <button onClick={handleOrder}>Place Order</button>;
};
```

## Rendering Strategies
Rendering in Next.js determines how your code is transformed into a user interface. There are various strategies for optimal performance, including:

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Suspense SSR Architecture**
- **Code Splitting**
- **Server Components**

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
In CSR, the browser is responsible for rendering components. This method is commonly used in Single Page Applications (SPAs) but is less optimal for SEO.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
In SSR, the server generates the HTML and sends it to the client, improving performance and SEO. However, SSR has its drawbacks, including increased bundle sizes and delayed interactivity due to hydration.

### Suspense SSR Architecture
Suspense SSR allows for HTML streaming and selective hydration, providing a smoother user experience by breaking rendering into smaller chunks.

### Code Splitting
Code splitting allows specific code sections to load only when necessary, reducing bundle size and improving performance. React.lazy and Suspense are used to achieve code splitting.

### Server Components
Server components run exclusively on the server, offering several benefits:

- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Server components do not send code to the client, reducing the client-side JavaScript load.
- **Direct Server Access**: Direct access to databases and file systems without exposing sensitive information to the client.
- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive data and logic stay on the server.
- **Improved Data Fetching**: Server components can fetch data without requiring client-side processing, improving performance.

### Server-Only Code
Certain code is intended to run only on the server, preventing sensitive logic from reaching the client-side. Client components handle user interactivity, while server components manage data fetching and secure operations.

### Static Rendering
Static rendering generates HTML pages at build time, caching them for fast delivery. This is ideal for content that does not change often, like blogs or documentation.

### Dynamic Rendering
Dynamic rendering creates HTML on demand, suitable for personalized content like social media feeds. This strategy uses functions like `cookies()`, `headers()`, and `searchParams()` to switch to dynamic rendering.

### Streaming
Streaming allows progressive UI rendering, sending content to the client in chunks, improving load times for large or complex pages.

### Parallel Routes
Parallel routes allow splitting a single layout into multiple slots, each with its own loading and error handling. This approach is useful when different slots have varying load times.

### Conditional Routes
Conditional routes enable you to render routes based on specific conditions, such as user authentication or permissions. You can use this feature to create personalized experiences.
